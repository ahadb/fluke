# Fluke JS

## Intro

A multi-purpose library that generates random strings, sentences, numbers, software languages and lot's of other things.

*This lib is still work in progress.*

## Environment

You can use Fluke JS in Node or in the browser:

Node: Download the pacakge and require the library:

``` javascript
npm install -g fluke
var fluke = require('fluke')
```

Browser: Build and add reference to your html:

``` html
<!-- install fluke script in head -->
<script src = "fluke.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

You can create a new instance of Fluke: `var myFluke = new Fluke` - all instances will inherit methods from the prototype.

 ``` javascript
 // then in your code:
 myFluke.gender()
 ```
Fluke comes pre instantiated when in the browser environment. If you've added a reference to fluke.min in your head an instance of fluke will already be availble to you

 ``` javascript
 // in your code
 fluke.gender()
 ```

## NPM Build Scripts / Installation

To install fluke simple use `npm`: `npm install -g flukejs`

* npm install
* npm run build
* npm run tests
* dist folder will contain your references
  * fluke.min,js
  * flke.sourcemaps


Note: fluke is not yet published on npm, it will be within the next couple of weeks
